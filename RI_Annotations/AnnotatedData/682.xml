HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old man who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit status post cardiac arrest .
History was obtained per the Emergency Department report as well as from the patient 's family .
Information was very limited regarding the circumstances of his cardiac arrest .
Reportedly , the patient was at a local restaurant where he was noted to be unresponsive .
EMS was called and reported to arrive on scene within three minutes .
The patient was asystolic but regained a perfusing rhythm after 2 mg of Epinephrine and 2 mg of Atropine .
He was intubated in the field and brought to the Emergency Department .
He remained unresponsive despite the administration of Narcan .
CT examinations of the head , chest , abdomen and pelvis were all unremarkable .
Initial chest x-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacity and prominent interstitium though his lung volumes were low .
Subsequent chest x-ray showed right main stem intubation with left lung collapse which had corrected with withdrawal of the endotracheal tube .
The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for induced hypothermia given his hemodynamic stability , ongoing unresponsiveness and recent out of hospital cardiac arrest .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac arrest - His arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission .
No further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization .
CT angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism .
The patient had an echocardiogram on 2013-04-26 , which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation ; otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen .
Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest , remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability , he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to 32 degrees Celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours .
This was done , however , as in problem number two below , we were not successful in any neurologic recovery .
Neurology - The patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia , the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids .
Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity .
Neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively , loaded with multiple drugs , including Ativan and Propofol drips .
The patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this .
He was loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb coma .
After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb , the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed .
Infectious disease - Over the course of his hospital stay , the patient 's white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17 .
Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia , pneumonia , and urinary tract infection .
For all these infections , the patient was treated with Vancomycin and he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission .
Blood cultures cleared by 2013-05-03 .
Sputum culture as late as 2013-05-10 , however was still positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
The patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his family with his son being his next of kin .
Ultimately it was decided that the patient 's wishes would be to not be maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only .
With these goals of care , the patient expired on 2013-05-11 .
The family did consent to a postmortem examination .
