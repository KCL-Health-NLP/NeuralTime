MEDICINE
History of Present Illness :
70 y/o male with h/o CAD s/p LAD PTCA 33 yrs ago , COPD , T2DM , and AICD pocket infection who presented to the Juan on 2017-09-03 with worsening SOB x 5 days and feeling ' cloudy .'
The patient was currently at Hubbard Regional Hospital and began to develop worsening SOB for the past 5 days .
This AM while talking with his daughter on the phone , he was noted to desaturate into the high 80s and he was brought to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Juan for further evaluation .
The patient states that he has felt ' cloudy ' of late which seems to relate to his worsening SOB .
He is not ambulatory and is very deconditioned secondary to several complications within the past two months related to an AICD pocket infection .
He denies any CP , N/V/D , abdominal pain , or HA .
He states that he only uses one pillow to sleep but admits to sleeping at about 30 degrees at rehab .
In the Juan , his VS were 97.8 150/80 88 12 89-94% 3L NC .
He was given Percocet for back pain , Lasix 80 mg IV , and Combivent neb .
For unclear reasons , he was placed on a NRB in the Juan .
Upon arrival to the CCU , he was hemodynamically stable .
He was quickly weaned to 3L O2 via NC , O2 sats 100% .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
70 y/o male with h/o CAD , T2DM , hyperlipidemia , and COPD who presented to the Juan on 2017-09-03 with worsening SOB x 5 days from Morton Hospital & Medical Center .
Pt. was initially admitted to CCU on 2017-09-03 , transferred to Pendleton on 2017-09-05 , triggered on 2017-09-10 for hypotension with BP 67/38 and transferred back to CCU on 2017-09-10 .
He remained fluid overloaded and a swan catheter was placed .
The following issues were addressed during this hospital admission :
1# Cardiac :
Pump
The patient was initially admitted for likely CHF exacerbation .
He was started on a lasix gtt the night of admission with a good response .
He continued to diurese and he was moved to the floor since he no longer required intensive level care .
While on the floor , he continued to be diuresed .
After several days , he became hypotensive and triggered for BPs 60s/30s .
He was given IVF without an adequate response in his pressures .
He was transferred back to the CCU and started on a dopamine gtt .
He diuresed well on the dopamine gtt and his BP was supported .
Gradually , the dopamine gtt was weaned .
However , he still appeared volume overloaded with minimal improvement in his oxygen requirement .
A swan was placed for a more accurate picture of his volume status and he was volume overloaded by swan numbers with an elevated PAD and elevated CVP without an obtainable wedge pressure .
He also had a high CO and low SVR suggestive of sepsis , but he never had an elevated WBC and was afebrile during his entire hospital admission with negative blood , urine , wound , and pleural fluid cultures .
The Lasix drip was eventually changed to IV Lasix boluses , with a net diuresis of over 36 liters for the hospital stay .
He was then transitioned to oral Lasix for maintainence .
The patient had an echo on 2017-09-04 with the results above in detail .
It was unchanged in comparison to 2017-08-14 with similar ventricular function and inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis .
The patient had another echo on 2017-09-14 with no new changes .
At discharge the patient was thought to be euvolemic , satting well on room air and without peripheral edema .
His dry weight is 70.4 kg .
Ischemia
The patient had an initial troponin bump on admission which was most likely secondary to CHF exacerbation .
He was continued on Aspirin , Metoprolol and Lipitor with no further issues .
Rhythm
The patient is completely pacer-dependent , being epicardially paced at 70 .
He is on Amiodarone for post-op afib and this was continued this entire admission .
His underlying rhythm is atrial flutter ; it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted .
Anti-coagulation was started with Warfarin 5 mg with a goal of 2-3 and a plan for cardioversion in 6 weeks .
The patient 's INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was held .
His coumadin was transitioned to 2 mg and then 1 mg .
His INR continued to flucuate .
He was discharged on 1 mg , but a stable regimen had not been achieved .
His INR will have to be monitored closely unitl his levels are stable .
His INR goal is 02-24 .
2# SOB on admission :
Likely due to CHF exacerbation , with diuresis of over 36 L during his admission .
He had 4 surgeries ( 3 cardiac surgeries ) earlier in the summer , so it is likely that he required copious IVF hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload .
It appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication non-compliance at rehab , per previous discharge summaries .
On discharge , the patient was maintained on standing diuretics as well as PRN nebs and INH COPD meds .
3# Metabolic Alkalosis / Hypochloremia :
Etiology most likely a combination of contraction alkalosis and / or post-hypercapnia .
This acutely worsened on 2017-09-18 , when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an ABG revealed a CO2 of over 100 , likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis .
The patient was therefore intubated for ventilation , and continued to be diuresed .
His CO2 improved and he was extubated after a few days .
All sedating medications were held and serial ABGs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis .
4# Pleural effusions : s/p right thoracentesis on 2017-09-06 , 1600 mL of serosanguinous fluid removed from right pleural space .
Gram stain and cultures were negative , cytology was negative .
The right pleural effusion slowly re-accumulated after tap but resolved after continued diuresis .
Repeat CXR showed improvement of the effusion and on discharge he had been breathing well on room air without complications
5# T2DM :
The patient was started on Glargine for tighter glycemic control and was covered with an insulin sliding scale .
He was monitored with QID fingersticks .
His blood sugars were in the 100s on discharge .
6# Hyperlipidemia :
The patient was continued on his statin .
7# COPD :
The patient was continued on nebs
8# MS changes :
The patient has a history of baseline dementia which was confounded by delerium in the face of metabolic abnormalities .
His mental status improved as his metabolic process was resolved as detailed above .
Neurology was also consulted and a head CT showed old lacunar infarcts but no acute causes for a change in mental status .
An EEG showed mild encephalopathy , but no other findings .
His mental status did clear somewhat with the addition of standing lactulose ; he was discharged on this medication .
9# Hypothyroidism :
The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Levothyroxine .
10# ? UTI :
The patient was started on levofloxacin at Newton-Wellesley Hospital for a question of UTI based on U/A positive for WBC .
UCx during this hospitalization were negative and Levofloxacin was d/c 'd .
11# Chronic lower back pain :
The patient was treated with a Lidocaine patch and Percocet prn .
Stronger narcotics were avoided given somnolence and MS changes .
12# Wound Care :
The patient has left chest wound and left gluteal pressure ulcer .
Wound care was consulted on 2017-09-05 and they made several recommendations .
For the left gluteal pressure ulcer , they recommended gentle cleansing with normal saline or commercial wound cleaner , thin layer of Duoderm gel , air dry , allevyn foam adhesive over the site , and change every 2 days or prn .
For the left chest wound , they recommended cleansing with commercial wound cleanser , pat dry , pack aquacel AG rope and moisten with saline , cover with dry gauze and change daily .
These recommendations were followed throughout the admission .
13# Voiding :
Pt. failed multiple attempts to void on his own .
Case was discussed with neurology .
He was started on finsateride on the day prior to admission .
He is scheduled to follow up with urology to address this issue .
Until then , his foley should remain in place .
14# Code :
The patient was full code during admission .
