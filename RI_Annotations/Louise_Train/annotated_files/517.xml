Admission Date :
2016-03-22
Discharge Date :
2016-04-04
Service :
MEDICINE
History of Present Illness :
75 yo F with CAD s/p MI x4 ( s/p LAD stent. '09 and RCA stent x 2 in. '00 and. '04 ) , CHF with EF 55% , PAF , Inducible Vtach s/p AICD placement , sick sinus syndrome s/p pacer and COPD with restrictive lung disease .
Per daughter , pt was in her USOH until two days prior to admission when she was noted to have a superficial ulcerations on her foot with erythema .
Pt was taken to Bridgewater Chelsea Soldier 's Home Hospital and started on unasyn IV .
Pt awoke later that night and felt unsteady on her feet and sustained a mechanical fall .
Per daughter , pt did not note chest pain , tachycardia , had a good PO intake and no noted seizure activity .
Pt was in severe " back pain " as per daughter which was treated with dilaudid .
CT of the neck revealed a possible C1 fracture and the X-ray at the OSH revealed intratrochanteric fracture of the right femur .
Pt was subsequently transferred to Hallmark Health System for orthopaedic evaluation .
In Monica at Hallmark Health System , pt was seen by the Trauma service where a CT of the neck revealed no fracture ( however , the c-collar was maintained secondary to pain ) .
The orthopaedic service recommended emergent repair of the intratrochanteric fracture secondary to instability .
The Monica stay was complicated by runs of afib to 133 requiring IV lopressor .
ROS :
Pt is very SOB at baseline , not on home ox , no CP at rest , no LE edema , no PND , stable orthopnea ( 2 pillows ) .
Pt ambulates 10 feet with significant fatigue as per daughter .
( ? dec in exercise tolerance ) .
CMED CCU change include discontinuation of coumadin secondary to inc risk of upper GI bleed .
Digoxin , Norvasc and Imdur was also discontinued .
HPI :
75 yo F with CAD s/p stenting , VT , SSS s/p pacer , COPD , presented to OSH 2016-03-21 with foot ulceration .
Started on unasyn , in hospital suffered mech. fall with hip fx .
Transferred to Hallmark Health System 03-22 .
Medically eval not high risk surgery , preop beta blocker given .
ORIF with repair of neck fracture 2016-03-23 .
Expected prolonged extubation course given COPD history , as with colon CA resection surgery .
In PM extubated , transferred to floor 2016-03-23 .
Late 03-23 found with afib and RVR , given beta blocker with min. response , started dilt. drip .
Received 2 mg dilaudid for pain o/n .
This AM with respiratory failure , continued tachycardia on dilt. gtt .
Transferred to unit and urgently intubated ( labs below. )
Of note , a NGT by Xray was not in correct position ? lungs -> possibly used for medication administration this AM .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
75 y F s/p MI x4 , numerous cath , PAF , Inducible VTach s/p AICD and pacer with severe COPD / restrictive lung disease s/p fall with intertrochanteric fracture .
As per CMED CCU , pt requires emergent repair of intertrochanteric fracture to preserve neurovascular function .
Pt is a moderate risk for a needed emergent non-cardiac procedure .
Pt is medically cleared for procedure. , likely has some mile rate related ischemia .
1. Cards :
--- Pre-op B-blocker with goal HR < 70
--- No real utility in MIBI / cath prior to procedure gien previous caths with no significant lesions to be intervened on .
--- V-Tach : pt has AICD in place , however b-blocker should contorl Vtach for now .
--- B-blocker IV , Dilt PRN for PAF
--- Hold coumadin for afib given hx of upper GIB and surgery in AM
--- Continue ASA , plavix
--- ROMI , check AM ECG
2. COPD / Restrictive lung disease :
--- Nebs / MDI PRN
--- no need for steroids now
--- expect prolonged wean given previous history of prolonged wean s/p colonic resection
--- incentive spirometry for atelectasis
3. Hip fracture :
--- pain control with diluadid , tylenol
--- lovenox tonight x1 , hold AM dose per CMED CCU
--- Pt to OR in early AM
4. Anemia :
--- iron studies
--- TSH
---no need for transfusion currently , keep Hct > 30
5. Hypokalemia :
--- 60IV K now
--- continue PO K
--- check lytes in PM
6. Cellulitis :
--- continue unasyn
--- hold off on X-rays for now
7. DM :
--- RISS - tight glucose control pre-op
8. PPx :
--- Protonix , Lovenox , R boot as per CMED CCU
9. Diet :
NPO
10. Code :
Full --> DNR / DNI
CMED course :
ORIF with repair of neck fracture 2016-03-23 .
Had expected prolonged post-op extubation in PACU given COPD history , as with colon CA resection surgery .
In PM extubated , transferred to floor 2016-03-23 .
Late 03-23 found with afib and RVR , given beta blocker with min. response , started dilt. drip .
Received 2 mg dilaudid for pain o/n .
On 03-24 AM p/w with respiratory failure , continued tachycardia on dilt. gtt.
Transferred to unit and urgently intubated .
Of note , there was a question of misplaced NGT .
When NGT tube was pulled out , it was noted to have respiratory-like secretions .
Concern for aspiration of mediations to lungs .
However , evaluation of CXR revealed NGT coiled in esophagus .
Pt 's respiratory distress is most likely on setting of aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis in the setting of depressed mental status secondary to post-operative narcotics .
Pt was pan-cultured and switched from unasyn ( started at OSH for foot ulcer ) to zosyn .
Vanco was added for possible nosocomial infection .
CTA was performed which was negative for PE , but revealed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities c/w aspiration vs. pneumonia vs. edema .
Pt was weaned down on ventilator , minimal secretions noted .
On 03-27 , pt was noted to have depressed mental status off all sedating medications ; mental status improved over the course of the day .
Pt was diuresed .
Atrial fibrillation was rate-controlled on dilt drip .
Dilt drip was discontinued and metoprolol titrated up .
Cardiac enzymes were cycled in setting of rapid AF and were flat .
Initially , pt was noted to be dry with low FeNa and given IVF .
Then , noted to be volume overloaded and diuresed with lasix .
Pt had depressed mental status on transfer to CMED in setting of narcotics .
She was then started on propofol while intubated .
Head CT was negative for acute bleed , mass effect , or stroke .
Mental status improved during times when propofol was held .
On 03-27 , pt was noted to have significantly depressed M.S. off propol improved off sedation .
All sedating medications including prn narcotics were held and mental status cleared somewhat .
s/p hip fx repair : started on lovenox for anti-coagulation .
Given standing NSAID , tylenol for pain control .
opiates used very sparingly in setting of MS change
On transfer to floor team from CMED active issues and plan included :
Resp failure / COPD :
Initially got steroids upon intubation .
Off for days now .
Extubated on 03-31 .
Still tachypneic and hypoxic on room air .
Lung sounds fairly clear .
? COPD vs atelectasis as cause of hypoxia .
On Blake , Nancy pe less likely
- atrovent standing .
prn albuterol only given A fib with RVR
- inhaled steroids
- obtaining pcp set of Reginald
Fever :
In the ICU .
Had received unasyn , vanc , zosyn during hospital course for cellulitis and other unclear reasons , including possible vent associated pna .
No true source found .
Afebrile > 24 hours off abx .
- culture if spikes .
No abx unless source found
a.fib with RVR - Has ppm , so can have lot of nodal agents .
Now rate controlled on metop 125 tid and dilt .
30 QID .
Titrate prn .
- continue nodal agents
- consider anti coag for cva prevention , but wait until ambulating better
CAD : on asa , b blocker , ace .
No statin .
need to clear with family
Heme - anemic .
Unclear baseline .
Possible anemia 03-02 operative blood loss .
Follow hct daily Goal > 28
Neck : never had c spine cleared by neurosurg .
Had fall pta with ? fx on initial CT , neg fx on f/u ct .
- flex / ext films done
- will clear with neursurg prior to removing hard collar
Overnight on pt 's first evening on the floor , she had episode of desaturation with inc O2 requirement ( 4L -> 6L -> sating 91% on NRB ) - CXR with worsening - non responsive to lasix .
Family meeting held and pt made clear wishes after extubation that she does not want to be intubated again and made DNR / DNI .
No BIPAP .
Now pt lethargic and min responsive .
All four children in pts room and agree on CMO - want to d/c c-collar and start morphine ggt .
Discussed with night float cover Dr. Dennis COmmander and Dr. Mike French .
Although Dr. Ray will be covering pt today , Dr. Stephanie Wilson spoke with family this morning and has noted that pt is CMO .
EP was called to deactivate pt dual chamber ICD as per family wishes .
On exam , pt lethargic , responsive to pain but not voice , with NRB in place ; obvious inc wob .
IV in R foot for access .
Family at bedside .
afebrile ;
BP : 159-161-139-98 ( after morphine )/ 69 HR : 148 --> 88 ; rr : 28-40 O2 : 94% NRB
As above , made CMO after meeting with NF team and family and reconfirmed with primary medical team on 04-02 .
Start morphine ggt and titrate to comfort .
D/c 'ed all lab draws / vitals .
Prn nebs for comfort .
Family at bedside and aware and in agreement of plan .
