Brief Hospital Course :
Patient was a 75 year old right handed male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin , coronary artery disease , hyperlipidemia , dementia with sudden onset left sided weakness , dysarthria .
Head CT demonstrated a large right intracerebral hemorrhage , centered around basal ganglia and putamen .
We felt this was likely secondary to hypertension .
While still in the emergency department , he had rapid decompensation necessitating intubation for airway protection .
Examination post intubation but off intubations showed clinical evidence of elevated intracranial pressure and brainstem compression .
The overall prognosis was guarded .
He was admitted to the Neurology / Neurosurgery ICU .
He was loaded with Mannitol and Dilantin in the emergency room .
He was evaluated by the Neurosurgery service and they did not feel a surgical intervention or ventriculary drain was warranted .
After arrival in the ICU , patient was followed with neuro checks every 1 hour .
Sedation was held to allow for frequent exams .
Head of bed was kept at 30 degrees .
Labetalol continuous infusion was titrated for systolic blood pressure of 130-160 .
Mannitol and Dilantin were continued .
After lengthy discussion , the patient 's wife opted to make him DNR on afternoon of 2013-11-11 .
Overnight , fresh frozen plasma was given for goal INR of < 1.4 .
On serial exams by neurology and ICU attendings in the morning on 2013-11-12 , patient had no clinical signs of brainstem activity .
Namely , he was unresponsive .
Pupils were fixed and dilated .
No corneal , gag , oculocephalic , and oculovestibular reflexes were elicited .
He was not overbreathing his ventilator .
At this point , patient was felt to have clinical signs consistent with brain death .
Plans were made to proceed with apnea testing .
However , after discussion with patient 's wife , this was postponed with test planned on 2013-11-13 .
Full medical care and managment continued overnight 11/9-11/20/2002 .
At approximately 06:00 on 2013-11-13 , the patient became bradycardic .
He lapsed first into a junctional rhythm and then had very infrequent ventricular escape beats on telemetry .
Finally , he went asystolic .
He was not resuscitated as per previous conversations with his wife .
Ronald was pronounced dead at 06:59 am .
The patient 's wife was notified .
The attending was notified as well .
