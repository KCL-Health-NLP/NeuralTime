Service :
NEUROLOGY
History of Present Illness :
79 - year-old M recently diagnosed by biopsy with gliomatosis cerebri ( grade II astrocytoma ) in 8/04 , being treated with XRT , timidar .
She is currently on a decadron taper after it was increased several months ago secondary to increasing ocular symptoms .
Seen by PMD on 12-14 w/ symptoms of cough productive of yellow sputum , which wife also had , prescribed zpak w/o improvement .
Pt was brought to the Victor for increasing somnolence over past several days-weeks .
Over the past two weeks , pt has declined in status .
He is confused , has had hallucinations .
Family believed pt was becoming dehydrated .
Also , pt 's strength has been declining over the past 2 weeks .
He used to be able to walk with a walker , and the past few days has required a wheelchair .
+ incontinence over the past 2 weeks .
+ non-bloody diarrhea x 1 on DOA .
In the Deborah VS on arrival were T : 97.5 ; BP : 90/65 ; HR : 82 ; RR : 16 ; 94 on RA .
CXR shows diffuse b/l infiltrates R > L and pt was found to have a bandemia .
LDH was 511 .
Pt received bactrim 500 mg x 1 for possible PCP .
Lillian R. / hypoxic respiratory distress .
During admission , became steadily more SOB , increasing lethargy .
12-20 satting initially ~ 90% on 40% face mask .
ABG 7.45/33/57 .
He was switched to a 100% NRB mask and ABG was 7.47/31/80 .
On floor on day of transfer 7.25/50/70 on 100% NRB .
During evaluation pt responsive to sternal rub but could not follow commands .
Intubated for failure to protect airway , transferred to ICU .
Brief Hospital Course :
Impression :
71 yo m w/ astrocytoma on xrt and chemotx , who p/w 1 wk h/o productive cough , sick contact , hypoxic , now intubated , w/ increasing infiltrates b/l .
1) Resp failure - pt admitted w/ primarily hypoxic respiratory failure .
Following admission to the floor the pt developed increasing hypoxia and somnolence , requiring intubation on HD 5 .
Pulm had previously been consulted and felt that presentation was c/w PCP , Joann started on Bactrim .
Previously treated for CAP as outpt but hypoxia continued to progress .
Similar lack of improvement w/ additional broad spectrum coverage following admission .
Pt underwent bronchoscopy on 11-22 following transfer to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and intubation ( 7.25/52/70 on 100% NRB ) .
On admission to the ICU the pt ' steroid dose was increased to 8 mg bid 01-07 to a dead space measurement of 50% .
Pt did well in the ICU , w/ his respiratory status steadily improving and was extubated on
01-03 .
He was subsequently tranferred to the floor , where he continued to have a stable oxygen requirement .
Repeat CXR was unchanged from previously in the ICU ( official read noted mild CHF , but pt was continuing to autodiurese and has remained net negative everyday while on the floor .
On discharge the patient has stable O2 req , 90% on RA .
2) astrocytoma - grade II , as per d/w PMD , Dr. Holscher , pt has poor prognosis , but reasonable for ongoing treatment .
Pt has had two recent neg head CT s , so unlikely the etiology of the patient 's MS change .
Pt was continued on keppra during admission for sz px .
Initially he had been on lamotrigine but the was stopped in 01/12 when the pt was noted to be developing a new rash .
Decadron has been steadily tapered since arrival on the floor .
Now continued on 1 mg BID , to complete a 7 day course , which will be tapered to 1 mg qday on 01-15 , and subsequently to 0.5 mg qday x 7 days then to be discontinued .
The patient 's keppra should be continued for sz prophylaxis .
3) MS change - on admission pt was agitated , requiring restraints and antipsychotics , however as he became increasingly hypoxic he became somnolent .
In the ICU the pt remained stuporous , responsive to painful stimuli .
On the floor the patient intially was imporved , but has plateaued , responding to simple commands and verbalizing groans but no real speech .
Improvement has correlated w/ tapering of steroids , one of the causes in the differential .
Pt had multiple head CT s which ruled out progression of astrocytoma .
MRI has been deferred given that the pt currently would not tolerate the procedure .
EEG was w/o evidence of epileptiform activity and c/w toxic encephalopathy .
Plan to continue to follow MS , expect improvement as steroids are continued to be tapered .
4) h/o DVT - cont heparin , previously on enoxaparin x10 days at treatment dose , followed by prophylactic dose .
On admission , the pt was started on treatment doses of enoxaparin .
Upon transfer to the Intensive Care Unit the pt was started on heparin gtt .
Course was c/b one episode of gross hematochezia on 12-28 , w/ concomitant hct drop of ~ 3 pts .
B/L lower ext duplex us and a cta were performed , both of which were negative .
Given that the pt was w/o evidence of DVT it was felt that the risks of anticoagulation in the setting of gross GIB , outweigh the risks of undetected deep vv thrombosis/pe .
Pt was continued on prophylactic heparin .
4) hypersensitivity reaction - on 11-24 pt was noted to have developing rash of abdomen and anterior thighs .
Derm initially reviewed and thought that it was not c/w hypersensitivity rxn .
Over the next the rash progressed , and the patient subsequently began spiking fevers to approx 103 F , c/b hypotension requiring aggressive fluid repletion and pressors , and tachycardia to the
130s .
The patient also developed elevated transaminases and pancreatic enzymes during this time .
On the second day that the rash had been noted , Derm was asked to see again , felt c/w hypersensitivity , bactrim was switched to pentamidine , and lamictal was held .
Pt continued to have elev pancreatic enzymes and pentamidine was switched to clinda/primaquine .
Following discontinuation of the bactrim the patient defervesced , and remained normotensive .
He received one dose of furosemide in the ICU and was transferred to the floor the next day .
On arrival to the floor the patient was noted to have a lacy reticular rash of upper arms , which resolved over the next 48h .
Felt likely 01-07 the sulfa moiety of the furosemide .
Plan for pt to complete total of 28 day course of therapy for PCP , James will be completed on 01-16 .
5) Anemia - previous w/u c/w ACD ( elev ferritin , low transferrin saturation ) .
- transfuse threshold < 24
6) ARF - Cr mildly elevated on tx to ICU , u lytes c/w prerenal azotemia , which resolved w/ IVF .
7) hyponatremia - also hyponatremic on transfer , resolved w/ ivf .
8) CAD - w/ abnl EF , however pt tolerated aggressive fluid resusciation w/o significant hypoxia .
Continued on valsartan , BB continued , statin
9) Nutrition - pt was maintained on TFs via post-pyloric
10) Px : Heparin ( full dose ) , IV PPI
11) Comm : Family very involved at bedside , evaluating rehab today
17) DNR , but may intubate for reversible causes
18) Restraint
