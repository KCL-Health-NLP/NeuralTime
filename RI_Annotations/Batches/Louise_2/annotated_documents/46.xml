Admission Date :
12/22/2000
Discharge Date :
01/01/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 80 female with a history of diastolic function and heart failure , hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis who presents from an outside hospital with presyncope .
The patient reports dizziness intermittently times several months now increasing in frequency described as episodes where she feels faint .
The room spins with no visual changes , no loss of consciousness , no palpitations or chest pain , no shortness of breath or diaphoresis .
On the day of admission , the patient was with some friends , rose from a chair to leave and felt dizzy while ambulating , fell and hit elbow with minor head trauma .
The patient denied loss of consciousness , no bowel or bladder incontinence .
The patient was transferred to an outside hospital where she was noted to have a 50 point discrepancy in her upper extremity blood pressures , right greater than left .
This had been noted in the outpatient setting approximately one to two years prior to admission .
The patient had no mediastinal widening on chest x-ray , but was transferred to Verg Medical Center for further evaluation .
In the emergency room , the patient &apos;s temperature was 98.8 degrees , heart rate 73 , respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air .
Blood pressure in the left arm demonstrated 125/89 , blood pressure in the right arm was 177/119 .
The patient had a systolic murmur 3/6 that radiated to the carotids with a decreased left radial pulse per the emergency room .
The patient had a chest CT scan demonstrating no dissection or evidence of congestive heart failure .
She received Nitropaste , aspirin , laboratory studies and was taken to the floor for further management .
The patient denies melena , bright red blood per rectum , no emesis , or fevers or chills .
The patient has a history of anemia as per past medical history above .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Otherwise negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Cardiovascular :
The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
She remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .
The patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .
The patient &apos;s Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .
The patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .
At this time , the patient &apos;s presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .
2 ) Neurological / vascular :
The discrepancy in the patient &apos;s pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .
The patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .
The left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .
The patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA .
MRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .
The patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .
The patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .
The results of these studies suggested that the patient &apos;s symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .
A Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient &apos;s intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .
3 ) Orthopedic :
The patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .
Outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .
Repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .
An Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance .
A bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .
At the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .
Plans were made for the patient to be discharged to Dwardmegriff Rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .
4 ) Gastrointestinal :
The patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .
The patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .
The patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .
However , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .
The patient &apos;s emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .
The etiology of the patient &apos;s nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .
The patient was started on Meclizine on December 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .
An attempt was also made to reduce the patient &apos;s large number of medications and the patient &apos;s Os-Cal , multivitamin , Lasix and Colace were discontinued .
5 ) Infectious disease :
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on December 30 , 2000 .
Urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .
The patient was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .
The urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .
6 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient had a mild increase in her BUN and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids .
The patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake .
