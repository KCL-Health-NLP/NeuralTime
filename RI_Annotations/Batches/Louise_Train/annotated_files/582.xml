The patient did well until approximately three to four weeks prior to presentation when he began to experience increased dyspnea on exertion .
One week prior to presentation , he had chest pain leading to a repeat catheterization at Springfield on 07-30 which showed narrowing of the stent and an ejection fraction of approximately 20% .
No intervention was done at that point .
On the evening prior to admission , the patient was awoken with chest pressure radiating to the neck anginal
