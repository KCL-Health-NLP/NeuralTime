History of Present Illness :
Pt is a 78 yo male with h/o A fib , s/p multiple CVA s, CHF , HTN , DM2 admitted to Mediplex Rehab Hospital Robert on 02-01 with abdominal pain and n/v since that morning .
Pt 's vitals on admission wer significant for T 104 , SBP 100 s, HR in the 120 s.
RUQ U/s demonstrated multiple small gallstones with sludges without evidence of pericholecystic fluid or significant dilatation of the gallbladder .
Surgery was consulted for concern of cholangitis with probable sepsis .
Pt was admitted to the CMED CCU , intubated overnight for ERCP procedure and fluid resuscitation .
The patient was placed on zosyn .
Pt 's INR was eleveted as he was on home coumadin .
He was given 4 units FFP in anticipation of ERCP the following day .
On 02-02 ERCP demonstrated a large filling defect in the distal duct representing a stone with CBD dilatation .
A biliary stent was placed after the removal of the stone .
Pt was extubated the next day .
He was then transferred to the medicine service .
Brief Hospital Course :
Pt is a 78 yo male with atrial fibrillation , s/p multiple CVA s, CHF , HTN , DM2 transferred from the CMED CCU s/p intervention for cholangitis .
1) Acute cholangitis : Pt was admitted to the ICU , intubated , and ERCP performed , likely stone obstructing CBD .
Stent was placed and patient was treated with antibiotics ( Zosyn - > Ciprofloxacin ).
Per ERCP fellow , plan is for patient to return in four weeks to see Dr. Suzanne Davis , at which time he will likely have repeat cholangiogram and removal of stent and stone .
If this is still problematic , pt may also need a sphincterotomy .
Dr.Demby secretary will contact patient at home the week after discharge to schedule this for the end of January .
Pt is to continue ciprofloxacin for a complete 14 day course .
2) Mechanical mitral valve : Anticoagulation was reversed for ERCP .
After this he was anticoagulated with heparin drip .
INR was 1.9 on discharge .
He was given sc lovenox x 1 and will continue this the day after discharge bid for one day .
VNA will check his INR at home and page his PCP with the results .
3) Atrial fibrillation : Rate controlled and on warfarin .
While in the hospital he had several episodes of pauses , none longer than 2.5 seconds .
His digoxin was held and his metoprolol was titrated down from his home dose .
Once the digoxin was no longer having effect , metoprolol was titrated back to home dose .
4) CHF : Pt was oxygen dependent for most of the hospital course , CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema .
He was diuresed with lasix with good effect .
Volume overload likely ocurred in the setting of IV fluids given in the ICU .
Did not require lasix on discharge .
5) E. coli bacteremia / sepsis : Source of acute cholangitis as above .
Pt required 3 day stay in the surgical ICU and intubation as above .
6) Intubation : Pt was 97% on room air on arrival to Cindy , developed rapid ventricular reponse to a fib which was treated , but after that period of time required oxygen , presumably for pulmonary edema .
In the Lori pt was given 3L NS as well as 1 unit of FFP , and oxygen requirements contimued to climb .
In the CMED CCU pt was intubated for ERCP procedure .
He was extubated the next morning .
