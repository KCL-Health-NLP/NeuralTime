History of Present Illness :
69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD , type 2 DM , and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the Juan with sepsis of unknown etiology .
Pt was recently admitted to The Hospital for Orthopedics from 12-07 thorugh 12-14 with hypotension thought to be secondary to overdiuresis at HD.
However , a septic component to the hypotension was also considered as the pt was found to have citrobacter in her urine and C diff in her stool .
Pt was then discharged to Arbour-Fuller Hospital Senior Life where she was in her normal state of health until three days ago .
Her son reports that she then developed a headache and fevers started three days ago which were treated with tylenol .
Then , this morning she developed fatigue and did not eat well .
He son also notes that she appeared to be working hard to breath .
She was found to be febrile to 101.9 and received levoflox and vancomycin .
Pt was then sent to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Juan for further evaluation .
Per notes , pt denied SOB , CP , and abdominal pain prior to intubation .
She did complain of a left frontal headache .
In the Juan , the pt 's VS were singificant for a fever of 103.8 , tachycardia in the 130s-150s , and initial hypertensive in the 140s .
Her oxygen saturation was 96% on RA but she was tachypneic to 31 .
She was obtunded and was thus intubated for airway protection .
Post-intubation , the pt 's BP acutely dropped to 58/19 in the setting of propofol .
When this medication was discontinued , her BP came back up to the 70s-90s / 30s-50s .
Pt was then initiated on the sepsis protocol .
In the Juan , she received vancomycin , levofloxacin , flagyl , and cefepime ( 2 gm ).
She received a total of 4 liters of NS then was started on levophed for continued hypotension .
Pt is now transferred to the FICU for further care .
Per pt 's son , she is bedbound at baseline due to her multiple LE femur fractures .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD , type 2 DM , and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the Juan with sepsis of unknown etiology .
1. Sepsis / ID- Started on sepsis protocol .
Unclear etiology headache over the three days prior to admission in association with fever was concerning for a CNS etiology .
Covered broadly with vancomycin , flagyl , and cefipime .
Given stress dose steroids empirically and Sanchez stim showed cortisol of 9.3 --> 10.3 therefore steroids continued .
CXR , LP , UA and abdominal CT showed no sign of infection .
PICC line was removed empirically .
Tip could not be cultured due to contamination .
Cultures drawn off the HD cath are negative to date .
Patient 's LE ulcers appear chronic and do not appear to be the source of infection .
Her left knee is slightly erythematous compared to the right but not impressive .
Joint is mobile .
Nasal washings for influenza were negative ; culture pending .
Patient improved over the next few days .
Steroids were discontinued .
On 12-18 flagyl and cefepime were discontinued as all culture data negative to date .
Plan to continue vancomycin for 08-19 day course to treat empiric line infection .
Urine culture came back positive for VRE , however , since patient improved without treatement ( ie Linezolid ) initially .
After transfer to the floor when she was stable .
On the floor the Vancomycin was discontinued as the catheter tip culture was negative .
ID was consulted who suggested broad spectrum antibiotics if she were to spike .
When pt spiked a temperature and became hypotensive she was started on Linezolid was started for presumed VRE infection in the urine .
She will be treated for total 14 day course .
She was also started on fluconazole for yeast in the urine , to be treated with fluconazole for total 7 days .
She was given Flagyl for presumed C. Diff. Colitis , however this was stopped when C. Diff B toxin came back negative on 2019-01-10 .
The tunneled catheter line was changed over a wire and the tip was also negative .
2. Respiratory - Intubated for airway protection due to change in mental status .
Extubated 12-28 with no incident .
3. ECG changes - Patient had an episode of chest pain during her hospital stay that was both right and left sided with no radiation and no associated symptoms .
ECG showed new diffuse TWI in all leads .
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were normal .
Echo was obtained which showed WMA and EF of 35-40% .
Pt was note started on ASA as she does not tolerate this well , BB was also not started given SBPs in the 110s .
Statin was also deffered .
She may be started on ASA , BB , statin by PCP as Stephen .
4. Shoulder fracture - Patient is s/p a left hip fracture ( decision not to operate ) and a left shoulder fracture with hemiarthroplasty 11-14 .

Assumed to be secondary to trauma when moving patient into ambulance .
CMED service was consulted and recommended wtd woulnd care and sling at all times .
Wound care should be continued as described after discharge .
5. Type 2 DM - Patient was initially covered with an insulin drip while septic and then transitioned back to insulin sliding scale .
6. ESRD on HD - Pt has ESRD secondary to her DM and is on HD .
She was dialysed but was slightly limited by hypotension .
Dialyzed 12-28 with plan to dialyze again 12-31 .
Her dialysis was managed by renal service in house .
7. PE ( 11-14 )- On heparin drip .
Restared coumadin on 12-29 .
Heparin discontinued on 01-01 when INR was 2.0 .
Coumadin was stopped and she received fFP for tunneled line change over a wire .
Coumadin was restarted at a dose of 2 mg qhs .
This should be titrated after discharge for INR goal of 2-3 .
8. PVD :
Dry gangrene of toes bilaterally w/ necrosis of the heels and posterior calf .
Continue to monitor for sign of infection .
On vit C. and zinc as well to aid w/ wound healing .
Wound care consult given anasarca to prevent decub .
