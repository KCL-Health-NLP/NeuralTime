ADMISSION DATE :
9-2-94
DISCHARGE DATE :
9-18-94
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
September 11 , 1994 , coronary artery bypass surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Coumadin 5 mg PO q.day , Digoxin 0.25 mg PO q.day , Metoprolol 25 mg PO b.i.d. , Baby aspirin 80 mg PO q.day .
The patient will be followed by the Anticoagulation Clinic for prothrombin time level evaluations and appropriate Coumadin doses .
IDENTIFYING DATA :
The patient is a 66 year old Portuguese speaking gentleman with a history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , increasing cholesterol , and history of tobacco use , who is status post myocardial infarction in September of 1993 and February of 1993 , who presented with new onset of left chest pain and arm pain for two days .
Apparently , patient was in his usual state of health until two days prior to admission when he noted new onset of chest pain and arm pain , confined to his left side .
The chest pain was considered mild but persistent with episodes lasting twenty minutes .
He came to the emergency room with chest pain on July 22 , 1994 , relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin .
No history of nausea and vomiting or shortness of breath .
Denies fevers , pleuritic chest pain or cough .
The electrocardiogram showed pseudonormalization of T waves in V1 through V6 and Q waves in V1 through V3 .
The patient &apos;s past cardiac history is significant for an anterior myocardial infarction in September of 1993 and a non-Q wave myocardial infarction in February of 1993 .
The patient in September of 1993 had 3-4 millimeter ST segment elevation in V1 through V4 and depression in II , III , and AVF .
At the time , patient had bright red blood per rectum as well and patient had cardiac catheterization at the time which showed 95% left anterior descending , which was percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied and had intra-aortic balloon pump placement .
He had a CPK of over 5000 with MB fraction of 26.7 .
The echocardiogram showed a 44% ejection fraction with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .
He had a positive exercise tolerance test with Thallium and repeat cardiac catheterization showed left anterior descending being patent and distal posterior descending artery lesion with circumflex lesion after the obtuse marginal 1 .
In February of 1993 , patient again presented with chest pain , shortness of breath , ruled in for a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with CPK peak of 219 and MB of 20.9 .
Repeat cardiac catheterization showed re-stenosis of proximal left anterior descending that had been percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplastied and a lesion in the first obtuse marginal and a moderate to severe left circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal .
He also had an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Again , patient &apos;s cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , increasing cholesterol and a positive family history and tobacco use .
In the past , patient had been noted to be non-compliant with cardiac medications and continues to smoke .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with CPK maximum on hospital day number one peak of 186 and iso of 23.8 and index of 12.8 on September 2 , 1994 .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Signs for Dr. Churlaunt of Cardiology .
The patient received the appropriate protocol for myocardial infarction , intravenous heparin , aspirin , and beta blockers for rate and blood pressure control .
The patient on the date of September 5 , 1994 had cardiac catheterization which showed normal resting hemodynamics .
The patient has a small non-dominant right coronary artery , left anterior descending showed severe proximal lesion with more distal lesions of diagonal one .
The left circumflex was dominant with severe disease of obtuse marginal one , with moderate mid-circumflex stenosis and moderate posterior descending artery lesion .
The left ventriculography shows anterior akinesis and apical severe hypokinesis with a moderately depressed ejection fraction , cardiac output of 3.9 , index of 2.0 .
The patient was seen in consultation by Cardiac Surgery for evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafting .
The patient had stable hematocrit of 38% on intravenous heparin .
The carotid noninvasives preoperatively were negative .
Dental consult was negative .
On the date of September 11 , 1994 , patient underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting with saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery , circumflex and diagonal and left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending .
The patient had a bypass time of one hour and fifty minutes with good urine output and pre-bypass cardiac output of 4.0 , post-chest closure 5.3 , arrived to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on Nipride , Lidocaine of 1 and Fentanyl/ Versed of 10 .
The postoperative hematocrit was 26% .
The patient had a routine postoperative course in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with a postoperative BUN and creatinine of 11 and 1.2 with good urine output of over 100 an hour and patient received two units of packed red blood cells , fresh frozen plasma and platelets for increasing chest tube drainage .
The patient on the date of postoperative day number one , September 13 , 1994 , was transferred from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit up to the FIH 18 floor .
The patient &apos;s only post-Surgical Intensive Care Unit course was remarkable for hypertension requiring Nipride and bleeding which was controlled with fresh frozen plasma , platelets .
The patient had a stable hematocrit of 30% with CPK &apos;s postoperatively maximum MB fraction of 78 .
On postoperative day number three , patient went into atrial fibrillation , which was treated appropriately with metoprolol and digoxin and converted back to sinus rhythm .
The patient continued to need diuresis .
The postoperative medications up on FIH were Coumadin , baby aspirin , Isordil 10 PO t.i.d. , Digoxin .25 q.day , metoprolol 25 PO b.i.d. ______________
Chest tubes and wires were all discontinued according to protocol on postoperative day number four .
The Isordil was also discontinued .
The patient &apos;s incisions sternal and right leg were clean and healing well , normal sinus rhythm at 70-80 , with blood pressure 98-110/60 and patient was doing well , recovering , ambulating , tolerating regular diet and last hematocrit prior to discharge was 39% with a BUN and creatinine of 15 and 1.0 , prothrombin time level of 13.8 , chest X-ray prior to discharge showed small bilateral effusions with mild cardiomegaly and subsegmental atelectasis bibasilar and electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement and no acute ischemic changes on electrocardiogram .
Note :
patient needs anticoagulation for large saphenous vein graft to prevent any possibility of thrombosis .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with his cardiologist and will follow up with Dr. Hemp and Dr. Signs .
A NECESSARY , M.D.
