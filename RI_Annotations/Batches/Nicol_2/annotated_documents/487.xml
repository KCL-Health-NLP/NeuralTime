HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 55 - year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was referred to Dr. Brenda Hummer for discussion for surgical options to free this condition .
The patient reportedly had been experiencing increasing fatigue and dyspnea with exertion for the year prior to his admission .
The patient reported increasingly frequent episodes of dizziness and shortness of breath accompanied with coughing spells after walking approximately a half a mile or climbing three flights of stairs .
On 2010-05-27 , an echocardiogram was done which revealed critical fibrocalcific aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 125 mmHg , a mean gradient of 74 mmHg , an Oak Bluffs of 0.44 , and 1+ aortic and mitral insufficiency .
The patient subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on 2010-06-01 , which demonstrated no hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease , but critical aortic stenosis consistent with his echocardiogram study results .
The patient was subsequently scheduled for a mechanical aortic valve replacement procedure with aortic replacement on 2010-06-07 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 2010-06-07 , the patient underwent a mechanical aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm Carbomedics mechanical valve and a Supra coronary aortic graft with gelweave 28 mm .
The patient tolerated the procedure well with a bypass time of 155 minutes and a crossclamp time of
130 minutes , and a rest time of 16 minutes .
The patient 's pericardium was left open ; lines placed included a right radial line and a right IJ line ; both ventricular and atrial wires were placed ; two mediastinal tubes were placed .
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit , intubated , for further evaluation and management .
On transfer , the patient 's mean arterial pressure was 76 , CVP 12 , PAD 17 , and his Bennie was 25 .
The patient was AV paced at a rate of 88 beats per minute .
Active drips included milrinone , Levophed , propofol , and insulin .
On postoperative day number one , the patient was successfully weaned and extubated without complication .
The patient was then advanced to oral intake which he tolerated without complication .
On postoperative day number two , the patient 's chest tubes were removed without complication and the patient was subsequently cleared for transfer to the floor .
The patient was subsequently admitted to the cardiothoracic service under the direction of Dr. Brenda Hummer .
Postoperatively , the patient 's clinical course was largely unremarkable .
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy , who declared him a suitable candidate for discharge directly to home following resolution of his medical therapy .
The patient was advanced to a full regular diet , which he tolerated without complication , and had adequate pain control provided via oral pain medications .
The patient was begun on anticoagulation therapy for a target INR of 2.5 .
On the evening of postoperative day number four , the patient had a transient episode of disorientation and confusion which subsequently resolved spontaneously .
By postoperative day number five , the patient was noted to be afebrile and stable .
His incision was noted to be clean , dry , and intact with no evidence of cellulitis or purulent drainage .
The patient was noted to be independently ambulatory and was productive of adequate amounts of urine .
The patient was tolerant of a full regular diet and had his pain well controlled via oral pain medications .
The patient 's INR was noted to be 2.3 .
The patient was subsequently cleared for discharge to home with instructions for follow-up on postoperative day number five , 2010-06-12 .
