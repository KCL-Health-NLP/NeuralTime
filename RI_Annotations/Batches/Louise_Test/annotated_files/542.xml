Admission Date :

Discharge Date :
2016-04-03
Service :
CCU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 64-year-old female with a history of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , and dilated cardiomyopathy ( with a transthoracic echocardiogram in 2016-01-13 showing an ejection fraction of 40% , posterior and inferior apical akinesis , and large left ventricular thrombus ).
The patient was admitted from 2016-01-21 to 2016-02-03 ; at which time she was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
She had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease with normal left main , mid left anterior descending artery 60% , diffuse 90% mid distal stenosis at the origin of the diagonal , serial 70% and 90% left circumflex lesions , and 90% first obtuse marginal , and mid right coronary artery 60% .
During initial evaluation for a coronary artery bypass graft , 80% to 90% of the right coronary artery stenosis was found ; for which she underwent a right internal carotid artery stent .
She was discharged on Coumadin for a goal INR of 2.5 to 3 .
She was then admitted again on 2016-03-30 for an elective coronary artery bypass graft .
At surgery , the descending aorta was noted to be calcified , and an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an irregular intra-aortic pedunculated lesion .
Given the elevated stroke risk of aortic cross-clamping in the setting of this finding , the plan for a bypass graft was aborted .
The patient was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit Service for medical management in anticipation of possible percutaneous coronary intervention later in the admission .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 64-year-old female with 3-vessel disease who was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit Service for Western Mass . Hospital medical optimization and management following an aborted coronary artery bypass graft when a mobile aortic atheroma was noted .
The patient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , and statin .
Once the patient was titrated off dopamine , the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were restarted .
With regard to the left ventricular thrombus , her goal INR remained 2.5 to 3 ; and the goal was to start heparin once the patient was stable from a thoracotomy and chest tube
standpoint .
The patient remained comfortable .
By 04-01 , on postoperative day two , the patient was doing well and the chest tube was discontinued .
The patient still had transcutaneous pacing wires in place .
Likewise , on 04-01 , the patient was weaned off surgery without difficulty .
Thus , the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were started to be titrated up .
In addition , the patient was started on Wellbutrin for smoking cessation .
At this point , it was determined that the patient would not receive percutaneous coronary intervention on this admission and would likely be discharged to the floor for stabilization with followup .
The patient did well and was transferred to the floor on 04-02 .
After evaluation and a discussion with Dr. Gunter , it was determined that the patient no longer needed anticoagulation since there was no aortic thrombus but only an aortic plaque , and there was no anterior/apical akinesis noted .
At this point , the left ventricular thrombus ( for which she was initially started therapy for ) was no longer present .
The patient was noted to have a slight hematocrit drop and was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for a goal hematocrit of greater than 30 .
By 04-03 , captopril and atenolol were started , and the patient 's leg bandage from the vein harvest was removed .
The patient continued to do well on the medical regimen and was without chest pain , shortness of breath , or any other symptoms .
