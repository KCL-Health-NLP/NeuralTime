History of Present Illness :
This is an 83 y/o female with moderate AS , s/p MVR 27 years ago , s/p PPM , DM , CHF , p/w dsypnea and increased work of breathing x 4-5 days .
Per family , the patient has had worsening CHF/volume overload over the last several weeks , requiring supplemental O2 at rehab .
Over the last few days , she has been noted to be more short of breath and having sats to 60% on RA .
Her lasix was increased to 60 mg bid .
Beginning today , she was noted to be in hypoxic respiratory distress , 87-91% on 2L/NC .
She was increased to 5L , with her sats going up to 97% .
She was also noted to be more confused over the last few days and especially today .
She was given lasix and 2 mg IV morphine at New England Sinai Hospital & Rehab Center Rehab , and sent to Nantucket Cottage Hospital for further evaluation .
En route , she was given additional lasix of 60 mg IV and nitro spray x 2 .
In the Deanna , her VS were Tc 97.2 , BP 146/25 , HR 70 , RR 27 , SaO2 95%/NRB .
Foley was placed in Deanna .
She was given 40 mg IV lasix and 325 mg ASA .
She was placed on BiPAP for comfort at 30% FiO2 , 5 PEEP , 12 PS .
Admitted to the CMED CSRU for further management .
Per family , besides the dyspnea and SOB , the patient has had no other symptoms , including f/c/s , CP , palpitations , abd pain , n/v/diarrhea .
She has had decreased appetite over the last few days in the context of increasing confusion .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P - 83yo F with valvular disorder , AF , and h/o CAD a/w hypercarbic respiratory failure .
# Respiratory failure - She was admitted to the CMED CSRU for her repiratory failure which was thought to be secondary to CHF .
Pt was diuresed with iv lasix / acetazolamide and given iv morphine / prn for respiratory distress and BIPAP was tried .
However , hypercarbia ( 04-11 metabolic alkalosis ) remained in the 90s .
Pt was mentating okay , having conversations with intermittent somnolence despite hypercarbia .
TTE showed preserved EF with moderate AS and moderate MS and mod pulm HTN .
Cardiology was consulted and thought MS Harold Holcomb to her pulm edema and pulm HTN .
Cardiology recommended d/cing digoxin and starting amiodarone .
Family declined valvuloplasty .
For possible COPD , pt was started on steroids and nebs on 08-03 .
Pt is currently satting 90s on 1 L NC while sitting in a chair but needs more O2 when supine .
Pt is a mouth breather and occasionally needs a face mask .
Pt will need I/Os monitored to goal even to slightly negative as she was diursed 4.8 L during her CMED stay .
Depending on her I/O , lasix and acetazolamide can be decreased or discontinued .
If she were to decompensate at the rehab , goals of care will need to be readdressed .
# h/o CAD - There were new changes on EKG but pt was ruled out with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes .
Pt was continued on BB , ASA , and nitrates .
# Acid / base status - Respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation .
Appears to be chronic in nature given degree of metabolic compensation with acute component earlier today .
Pt failed BIPAP and pCO2 remained in the 90s but maintaining mentation .
# Renal insufficiency - baseline Cr unknown , may have CRI from DM .
Creatinine stayed stable from 1.3-1.5 .
Will need to renally dose all medications .
# A fib - continued BB .
Per cardiology consult recs , discontinued digoxin and started amiodarone .
Due to elevated INR , coumadin was held .
Pt is also paced .
Pt needs to be on amiodarone 400mg BID x 7 days ( loading dose ) and then 400mg daily for maintenance .
# DM - insulin standing + HISS , FS qid
# Depression - continued home regimen
# F/E/N - NPO initially while on BIPAP and now low sodium cardiac diet .
# PPx - supratherpeutic INR
# Access - PIV
# Code - DNR/DNI .
No pressors or central line per HCP .
If she were to decompensate at the rehab , goals of care will need to be readressed .
