The patient underwent TAH / BSO , partial omentectomy at CTMC in 10-90 .
At that time , tumor was found to be studding on the right diaphragm , gross tumor in the omentum and large bowel , tumor through the uterine serosa .
Pathology showed grade II-III papillary adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with squamous differentiation which was focally invasive and superficial myometrium .
The ovary showed papillary serous adeno with omental involvement consistent with an endometroid adenocarcinoma .
The question was whether or not whether she had two primaries vs metastatic endometrial cancer .
The patient underwent 6 cycles of CAP in Pemrancetul Tonsst ._
However _, during the fourth cycle _, Cytoxan was dropped .
Her CA-125 on 6-27-91 , was 249 and on 8-29-91 , was 734 .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent chemotherapy on the following doses :
IFEX 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days , MESNA 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days continuous IV infusion .
She had VP-16 mixed with 250 cc IV fluid given over 1 hour each day for 3 days .
She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient 's urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated , she received her IFEX / MESNA .
A repeat straight cath was negative for RBC 's .
After 1 day of chemotherapy , the patient had 8-10 RBC 's in her urine but by the second day of her IFEX infusion , she had 50-80 RBC 's in her urine as well as a few transitional epithelial cells .
Because of this finding , her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion .
Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion .
She did receive her VP-16 without complication .
Other significant issues were the patient 's hematocrit on admission at 31.1 which dwindled down to 26.2 by 9-10 ._
The patient was counselled and received 2 units of packed RBC 's at that time  .
However , the patient 's hematocrit bumped only to 28.1 and a repeat later on 9-11 , showed hematocrit of 27.6 .
At this time , an additional 2 units of packed RBC 's were transfused .
The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42.2 .
Her repeat on 9-8 , was 36.0 / 68.2 and her Coumadin was held .
She received no Coumadin during her admission and by the time of discharge , her PT was down to 16.2 .
She was restarted on Coumadin 2.5 mg per day .
The patient 's hematocrit on the day of discharge was 35.6 showing significant bump in her count after her second two units of packed RBC 's .
