CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 71 - year-old gentleman who was admitted to the St. Anne 's Hospital as a transfer from the Kindred Park View Specialty Hospital of Springfield .
Prior to admission , he had a long and complicated hospital course at the outside hospital .
His hospital course began on 2014-02-13 when he underwent a right carotid endarterectomy for 95% stenosis of the carotid artery .
His postoperative course was complicated by nonspecific T wave changes consistent with myocardial infarction postoperatively as well as hematoma formation .
The hematoma formation was rapidly expanding and he received an emergent surgical airway in the Intensive Care Unit .
This emergent cricothyroidotomy was converted then to a formal tracheostomy .
During his subsequent hospital course , he had an additional CHF exacerbation .
He was medically managed and eventually his tracheostomy was decannulated .
However , just prior to admission to Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary he had another acute decompensation with CHF exacerbation .
This necessitated emergent intubation .
With EKG changes consistent with myocardial infarction , he was transferred to the Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Knueppel was admitted to the CCU at the Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary .
Upon admission , he was treated for his pneumonia .
He was medically managed for CHF and underwent a cardiac catheterization on 2014-03-06 .
His catheterization revealed 70% stenosis of the distal left main coronary artery , 90% stenosis of the LAD , 80% stenosis of the circumflex , 90% stenosis of OM2 and a proximally occluded right coronary artery .
After reviewing cardiac catheterization data , a consultation was made with Cardiothoracic Surgery who deemed that he was a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting .
Over the ensuing days , Mr. Nina CHF was managed by the CCU Team and he received treatment for what was now determined to be a Klebsiella pneumonia .
He was treated with a full course of Zosyn .
On 2014-03-11 , Mr. Knueppel went to the Operating Room with Dr. Streeter .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft of four vessels .
He had a saphenous vein graft to his LAD and diagonal in a sequential fashion , saphenous vein graft to his PDA and a saphenous vein graft to his OM .
The procedure was performed by Dr. Streeter and assisted by Dr . .....................
The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit without complication .
Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details .
Mr. Knueppel had a long postoperative course .
His postoperative course was complicated by hypertension which was managed medically .
During his postoperative course , he did not suffer from any arrhythmias nor did he have any episode of hypotension .
At the time of discharge , he was on a stable antihypertensive regimen appropriate for someone with a decreased ejection fraction .
Mr. Knueppel had had a long protracted period of intubation prior to the operation .
The status of Mr. Nina pulmonary system necessitated a prolonged postoperative intubation .
After a very slow wean from ventilatory support , Mr. Knueppel was successfully extubated on postoperative day number nine .
He continued to be very tenuous from a pulmonary point of view and required frequent chest PT .
For this reason , Mr. Knueppel was kept in the Intensive Care Unit where very close monitoring could be performed .
In addition , he had chest PT performed at very regular intervals by the ICU staff .
His pulmonary status was so tenuous that we were unable to transfer him to the regular patient care floor during his hospitalization .
Mr. Knueppel had an emergent cricothyroidotomy followed by a formal tracheostomy at the outside hospital .
There is much scarring surrounding his larynx .
Such a situation frequently makes it very difficult to swallow without aspirating .
As is expected , Mr. Knueppel failed a swallowing study early on in his Boston Regional Medical Centerr hospital course .
The study was repeated and yet again Mr. Knueppel was unable to swallow without evidence of aspiration .
After a prolonged period of being fed via nasogastric tube , Mr. Knueppel finally had a formal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed in the Intensive Care Unit .
This was performed on 2014-04-01 , postoperative day number 21 .
This procedure was performed by Dr. Kevin Taussig and assisted by Dr. Carla Solan .
The procedure was performed under endoscopic guidance in the Intensive Care Unit without complication .
Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details .
Mr. Knueppel Robertson a distal radius fracture prior to arriving to the hospital .
This injury had been reduced and casted at the outside institution .
Postoperatively , there was much edema associated in the postoperative course from coronary artery bypass grafting .
His cast was removed by the Orthopedic Service in anticipation of this edema and to avoid compartment syndrome .
The cast was replaced by a plaster splint .
Mr. Knueppel should follow-up with his orthopedic surgeon in the Worcester State Hospital for reassessment of his injury and possible removal of the splint .
By postoperative day number 23 , Mr. Nina pulmonary status was deemed sufficiently stable .
His hypertension was well controlled and he was tolerating tube feeds .
At this point , he was ready to be discharged to rehabilitation .
