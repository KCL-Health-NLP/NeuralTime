Discharge Date :

Service :
BLUE GENERAL SURGERY
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Gonzalez is a patient with a prior medical history including hypothyroidism , iron-deficiency anemia , osteoporosis , increased cholesterol , peptic ulcer disease , chronic constipation , and status post appendectomy as well as status post hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
She was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation and treatment of adenocarcinoma involving the transverse colon and gallbladder .
At the outside hospital the patient had already seemed some workup for a couple weeks duration of bilateral upper quadrant pain which occasionally radiated to her back .
She was also complaining of fatigue for two weeks but a good appetite and the patient denied weight loss , melena , or bright red blood per rectum .
A CAT scan of the abdomen showed air-fluid levels in the gallbladder .
It also showed a thickened gallbladder wall as well as a dilated common bile duct .
Incidentally , it also showed diverticulosis .
A HIDA scan at the other hospital did not show filling of the gallbladder indicating some sort of
cystic duct obstruction .
The first imaging study that was done at Hahnemann General Hospital was a MRCP which revealed an enhanced thickened gallbladder wall consistent with chronic cholecystitis .
A differential according to the imaging included a fistula with adjacent inflammatory change but also carcinoma or adenomatosis .
In addition, also the MRCP showed a mass near the region of the neck of the gallbladder .
Of note , at the outside hospital , an endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed .
The colonoscopy showed two polyps and also a region in the transverse colon that was biopsied .
This biopsy came back as positive for adenocarcinoma .
The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was already established prior to her admission at this hospital .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was scheduled for an operative date on 2014-07-29 and over the next few days she was
given a low-residual diet .
She had her belly cleaned with Hibiclens one a day and once an adequate preoperative evaluation was performed , she was given a bowel prep on Monday afternoon and evening in preparation for an exploratory laparotomy on Tuesday , 2014-07-29 .
On the morning of 2014-07-29 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a cholecystectomy , partial hepatectomy , partial lymph node dissection , a colocolostomy , partial colectomy , and in addition a gastrostomy and a feeding jejunostomy were also put in place .
Please refer to the previously dictated operative notes for the details of this surgery .
Briefly , the surgery on 2014-07-29 revealed a carcinoma of the gallbladder with a cholecystocolonic fistula which crossed into the liver as well as metastatic adenopathy around the portal nodes as well as retroperitoneal nodes around the inferior vena cava and the hepatic artery .
In addition to the gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy tube , two Belmont-Gardner drains were placed .
The patient 's pain postoperatively was controlled with an epidural catheter .
However , the epidural had the consequence of causing a bit of a hypotension in the patient and the patient was admitted to the Surgical ICU for the first postoperative day .
In addition , the patient had low hematocrits which required a transfusion of packed red blood cells .
In addition , on postoperative day number two , the patient was transferred out to the floor and she was doing better in terms of pain control on a Dilaudid PCA machine .
On postoperative day number two , interestingly , the patient was complaining of sensitivity to light from an unknown etiology .
The patient 's postoperative course was unremarkable aside from the photophobia .
On postoperative day number two , an Oncology consult with Dr. Natalie Mcalister was obtained and
follow-up appointments were scheduled with him as an outpatient .
Following that , the patient was slowly advanced to clear liquids and to a regular diet once her bowels began working when she began having flatus .
Her bowel function was slow to develop and she needed to remain n.p.o. until postoperative day number six .
The patient was also given supplemental tube feedings to supplement her calories and caloric intake .
On postoperative day number seven , the patient was tolerating her clear liquid diet and her tube feeds .
She was started on p.o. medicines and her first Belmont-Gardner drain was pulled due to scant output .
By 2014-08-09 , the patient was tolerating a full solid diet as well as her tube feeds .
Between the two of those , her caloric intake was sufficient for her to sustain herself .
She was discharged to home with services including tube feedings for her home care .
Therefore , she was discharged on 2014-08-09 in good condition .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Metastatic gallbladder cancer .
2. Status post cholecystectomy .
3. Status post transverse colectomy with anastomosis .
4. G tube placement .
5. Feeding jejunostomy .
6. Hypothyroidism .
7. Blood loss requiring transfusion .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Levothyroxine 100 micrograms orally once a day .
2. Pantoprazole one tablet once a day .
3. Ambien 10 mg orally before bed .
4. Tylenol # 3 one tablet every four hours as needed for pain .
5. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at bedtime .
6. Colace 100 mg twice a day .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
Follow-up with the Visiting Nurses Association to arrange assistance with her tube feeding and
her activities of daily living .
The patient is also scheduled for an appointment with Dr. Patterson approximately two weeks after her discharge from the hospital .
