History of Present Illness :
82 F with h/o COPD , CAD , pafib and SSS s/p pacer on 05-08 for symptomatic pauses is transferred for large pericardial effusion ? needing drainage and CHF .
She was admitted to Cambridge Hospital 2018-05-24 with ARF ( Cr 3.5 up from 0.9 ) and SOB .
According to her guardian she was discharged to her NH for a few days after her pacer was placed 05-08 , which was complicated by a PTX requiring CT placement which had been d/c 'd in the hospital after resolution of her PTX .
She had some nausea / vomiting and generally was taking poor pos at her NH .
There had been some concern her nausea was due to her amiodarone which had been discontinued about 1 week ago .
She was then sent to Franklin Medical Center 05-24 with lethargy and n/v .
At Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center she was discovered to have ARF , a large pericardial effusion , and bilateral pleural effusions .
She was treated with IVF for her ARF .
She underwent a TTE at Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center today ( 05-26 ) showing mod-lg circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of RV diastolic collapse and no MV inflow evidence of tamponade , pacer wire located in RV apex .
There was still concern for her effusion contributing to her SOB at the OSH so she was transferred for drainage and treatment of CHF .
Today she only complains of some SOB , which she says remains largely unchanged over the past few days .
She denies any CP / cough / fever / abd pain / diarrhea / black or bloody stools / headache .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
82 y/o f w h/o afib , SSS s/p pacer 05-08 c/b PTX requiring CT , CAD , who was readmitted 05-24 with ARF and lethargy , found to have a large pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions , with echo showing no evidence of tamponade , who is transferred for possible pericardial effusion drainage and treatment of CHF , as well as drainage of bilateral pleural effusions .
She had a BNP of > 5000 on admission .
Since admission , she ruled out for MI by enzymes , and had a right sided thoracentesis which yielded transudative fluid .
WBC s since admission were as high as 14,000 but normalized .
She also had 2 echocardiograms which revealed persistent pericardial effusions .
She has been gently diuresed but has worsening ARF .
Her O2 requirement has increased despite diuresis .
She denies any CP / cough / fever , abdominal pain / diarrhea , black or bloody stools or headache .
Her urine output decreased to nearly zero .
In the setting of her ongoing pericardial effusion , she was transferred for closer observation to the CCU .
The CCU fellow and team declined to do pericardial drainage , as the pt was hemodynamically stable , without change in appearance of effusion by echo performed at bedside by cards fellow .
As she was felt by the CCU to be a poor candidate for right heart cath , was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure 110 s- 120 s systolic and pulse 70 s- 80 s , she was called out of the CCU and back to the cardiac floor without intervention .
The procedure team was called to consider doing a left thoracentesis , but she was declined because it was felt that her effusions were transudative , secondary to CHF , and it was recommended to treat CHF .
The pt continued to have low urine output .
She was given a lasix drip IV upon call-out of the ICU , and additional boluses of IV lasix , 200 mg then 300 mg IV were given with a good response , however , she remained net positive fluid balance .
Renal consultants did not feel there was an emergent need for dialysis .
A nitro drip was started in an effort to decrease her preload and afterload .
On call out from the CCU , the pt was satting 93% on 4-5L NC , and through the following night , her oxygen requirement increased to NRB , wherein she was satting upper 80 s- low 90 s.
ABG that evening was 7.29/51/56 on 4L NC and early the next morning , was 7.25/62/64 on NRB .
A CXR was performed the evening of 5/16 , showing moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions , stable cardiomegaly and a possible RLL infiltrate .
Vancomycin and Zosyn were started .
She was afebrile .
The morning of 5/17 , her pulsus parodoxicus was 12 .
Because of her ABG , and declining clinical status , the CCU was notified for possible transfer .
The CMED CSRU Intern called the Murphy , Robert Leigh , to give her the update with regards to the pt 's deteriorating clinical status .
It was felt that given her age , multiple co-morbidities , that her prognosis was poor even prior to CCU admission , possible pericardial drainage or repeat thoracenteses .
Goals of care were clarified with her Murphy , Robert Sanchez .
Explained to Lewin that pt will likely need to be intubated , as she cannot lie flat , and most likely cannot undergo pericardial drainage , thoracentesis , or right heart cath with BiPAP ( which would have been the next measure after NRB , and prior to intubation ).
Explained that despite these invasive measures , she still has a very poor prognosis .
Odell stated she had been thinking about this all night of 2018-05-30 , and agreed that this is not what the pt would have wanted .
Odell does not believe the pt would want to be intubated , with central line , right heart cath , in the CCU .
She requested the patient be made Comfort Measures Only .
She was DNR/DNI on admission .
This was documented in the computer , confirmed with Cardiology attending and fellow , and conveyed to the CCU staff , who were informed she may need to go for transfer ( which was subsequently cancelled ).
The pt will be made comfortable , with goals of care shifted towards suppressing her air hunger and pain .
#. SOB : Most consistent with CHF by exam , although unknown what the severity of her COPD is currently .
TTE revealed large pericardial effusion .
Pt is now s/p drainage of right pleural effusion , diagnostic and therapeutic , with studies consistent with transudate , etiology most likely 02-15 CHF .
We continued her albuterol / atrovent nebs , diuresis with IV lasix drip and boluses .
Her 05-27 CXR post procedure w/o PNX , effusion much improved , yet her 05-28 CXR worse than 05-27 with some reaccumulation of right pleural effusion .
Then , on 05-29 , she demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions ( reaccumulated ), right lower lobe infiltrate ( started on vanco / zosyn )-> put on face mask , given lasix x 1 bolus 100 mg , responded somewhat and o2 sat stable in low 90 s.
She was given 200 mg IV lasix X 1 with an additional 100 cc of urine output the evening of 5/16 .
Her lasix gtt continued during this time .
Her oxygen sats did not improve .
She was then made CMO .
See above .
#. Pericardial effusion : unclear etiology , OSH had raised question of RV perforation from pacer , however she had a normal echo appearance of lead , no tamponade by exam .
This has still be known to occur during the placement of pacemaker .
It was felt posthumously that her large pericardial effusion was most likely secondary to a complication of pacer placement , although this was not seen on imaging .
In the last 12 hours of her life , her pulsus was 12 , and she was felt to likely to have aspect of tamponade physiology , since her preload was reduced .
#. CHF : normal EF on TTE so possibly with diastolic dysfunction , ruled out for MI
- See course of diuresis above .
- We continued ASA / imdur / CCB / hold diovan until pt was made CMO .
#. Pleural effusions : Likely due to CHF although had some leukocytosis at admission to OSH .
Mary studies c/w transudate .
- After she was made CMO , the pt was started on Morphine gtt to maximize comfort and minimize air hunger .
#. Afib/SSS : She was A-paced , pacer placed 05-08 in DDDR mode , complicated by PTX requiring chest tube which resolved and tube was removed during admit for pacer , no evidence of PTX on most recent CXR .
Her pacer wires in correct position .
We continued amiodarone until pt was made CMO .
Anticoagulation has not been given this admission .
She was a poor anticoagulation candidate .
We started her on dilt for additional a fib control ( revert back to a fib on 05-29 ), which was stopped when the pt was made CMO .
#. Oliguric ARF : likely prerenal due to n/v poor po intake and poor forward flow , However , need to continue diuresis .
Her urine lytes consistent with ATN , FENA 4% .
Renal u/s negative for hydronephrosis .
Renal consultants did not feel that there was an indication for urgent hemodialysis .
She continued to put out low amounts of urine throughout the admission , despite aggressive diuresis with IV lasix gtt and boluses .
See above .
#. ID : initially had leukocytosis at admission , with chest CT showing possible underlying consolidations vs. atelectasis , levoflox started 05-24 and subsequently stopped ( no consolidations on CXR and afebrile ).
U/A on 05-27 c/w UTI .
Pt now on IV Ceftriaxone ( was on levoflox since 05-24 however UA now floridly positive ( more so than UA at OSH ) so felt possibly levo-resistant .
Pt started on CTX 05-27 .
She was empirically started on vanco/zosyn for empiric hosp acquired pna coverage
- possible opacity on CXR - along w/ leukocytosis .
#. Anemia : Unclear source .
She was guiaic negative .
- no transfusions , CMO/DNR/DNI
#. FEN : check lytes , most recently normal .
cardiac/renal diet
#. Access : PIV
#. Code : DNR/DNI/CMO verified with Robert Marks 2018-05-29
