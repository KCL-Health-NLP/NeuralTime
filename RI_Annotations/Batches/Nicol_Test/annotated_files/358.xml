DISCHARGE DATE :

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. Laymie Fournier and Dr. Leebjescobe in Co In Saorlirv Frea , West Virginia who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in May 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .
He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
He had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .
A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .
He was started on aspirin .
He has a family history of hypertension as well .
He was also placed on Vasotec .
A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .
A thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise .
An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .
Accordingly he was referred for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .
This lowered with IV nitroglycerin .
Selective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion .
He had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .
The situation was reviewed with his wife , Sligh .
She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the Leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .
It was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .
Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .
He developed epigastric pain on 07/31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .
He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .
He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .
Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. Slusslashgodle , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .
On 08/02/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. Thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .
He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .
A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .
After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .
He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .
He had good hemodynamics .
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .
He had a right bundle branch block .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged home .
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew .
