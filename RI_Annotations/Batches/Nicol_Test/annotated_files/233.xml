Service :
CCU
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 57 - year-old female with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia but no prior coronary artery disease history who presented with chest pain .
The patient reports the pain began at 4:00 p.m. on the day of admission .
She reports that it had essentially started earlier in the day with some GERD-like symptoms .
She had taken Maalox but had no relief with this .
The pain was intermittent through the day and then at 4:00 p.m. increased and was also associated with nausea and diaphoresis .
She reports that the pain shot through her back .
The patient has never had these symptoms in the past .
She arrived in the Emergency Room at 8:00 p.m.
At that time , the pain was unremitting .
In the Emergency Room , the patient was given Lopressor , nitroglycerin , and aspirin .
A TP3A inhibitor was not given for concern for dissection .
The patient was found to have 5057 E. Sixth Blvd. elevations in I , aVL , and V1 through V2 and ST depressions in II , III , and aVF .
The patient was taken emergently to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE : The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization where she was found to have two vessel disease .
The proximal LAD was found to have a 90% lesion with a septal branch with a 95% stenosis and a diagonal branch with 99% stenosis .
The patient had twin LAD stents to the LAD diagonal and LAD septal branches with Taxus stents .
This restored flow appropriately .
The patient also had proximal RCA lesion of 80% and a mid RCA lesion of 80-90% which were not intervened upon .
The patient was given an aspirin and Plavix and in addition started on a beta Elmore , Maxine ACE inhibitor , and these were titrated up as her blood pressure tolerated .
Given the fact that the patient had issues with muscle cramping with Atorvastatin in the past , she was started on Pravastatin which should give less of these side effects .
The patient will follow-up with Cardiology in one months time for further management of her coronary artery disease and further evaluation of her remaining RCA lesions .
2. PUMP : The patient had an echocardiogram to assess her LV function .
She was found to have an ejection fraction of 30-35% as well as an akinetic apex and apical mid and septal akinesis .
Given the fact that the patient had significant apical akinesis , she was started on heparin with a transition to Coumadin for anticoagulation for stroke prevention in the setting of apical akinesis .
On discharge , the patient was given Lovenox injections which should be continued until the patient reaches a therapeutic dose of Coumadin .
3. RHYTHM : The patient was monitored on telemetry throughout her hospitalization with no significant events .
The patient had an EP evaluation and will be followed-up by Dr. Welch .
14-087 , the patient had a signal-averaged EKG .
She will follow-up with Dr. Welch with an echocardiogram on 2015-07-24 in a meeting to discuss risk stratification for sudden cardiac death and possible ICD placement .
4. NEUROLOGY : The patient complained of left lower extremity weakness with ambulation two days after her cardiac catheterization .
The patient had no evidence for weakness on examination with good proximal and distal strength in the lower extremities as well as intact sensation .
The patient worked with Physical Therapy and was able to ambulate without difficulty .
She was also able to ascend stairs without difficulty .
The patient was already on an aspirin and Plavix should this represent a small stroke .
However , there was no evidence for neurologic deficit on examination and this will be followed-up by her primary care physician .
5. HEMATOLOGY : The patient was discharged on Coumadin for apical akinesis and stroke risk .
This will be further monitored by her primary care physician , Dr. Banks , who will adjust her Coumadin dose .
