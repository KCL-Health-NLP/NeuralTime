HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post a four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1983 , pulmonary hypertension , hepatitis C positive cirrhosis history with history of portal hypertension and status post an upper gastrointestinal bleed on 4-10-98 , who presents from Sondi Memorial for work up of pulmonary infiltrates , acute renal failure and pulmonary hypertension .
The patient presented to Sondi Memorial on 4-10-98 with fatigue and fall , found to have a hematocrit of 29 , baseline 37 .
The patient was transfused two units and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy done where it showed gastritis , candidal esophagitis and portal hypertensive gastropathy without varices .
A colonoscopy showed anteriordysplasia , no bleeding was seen .
The patient was discharged after one week on iron sulfate .
On 4-24 , the patient was seen again at Sondi Memorial when he experienced at home a fall , no loss of consciousness , positive substernal chest pain , pleuritic pain , shortness of breath and cough .
He went to Sondi Memorial where he ruled out for myocardial infarction and was found to have a left lower lobe infiltrate / pneumonia , started on cefuroxime .
His respiratory condition continued to deteriorate despite aggressive chest physical therapy for possible blood , given Lasix for congestive heart failure , became hypotensive , hypoxic and intubated .
The patient was found to have expanding pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray , developed acute renal insufficiency with minimal urine output , less than 10 cc an hour , started on dopamine for hemodynamic instability .
An echocardiogram was obtained on 4-26 which showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal _____ left ventricular function , severe right ventricular dilatation with septal hypokinesis and flattening with a question of right ventricular apical clot raised with mild aortic stenosis , severe tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure of approximately 70 millimeters , consistent with fairly severe pulmonary hypertension .
Blood cultures x two sent off with no growth .
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with flat creatine kinases and he was sent to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for further work up .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
At the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital he was quite hypotensive , requiring dopamine at 1,000 , Levo at 12 .
His chest x-ray showed diffuse patchy infiltrates on left lung with left upper lung patchy infiltrates and right hemidiaphragm elevated , consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome from possible pneumonia .
A urinalysis was obtained which showed blood , urine sediment was active with positive dysmorphic cells , red cell casts , and 1+ albumin with mild protein uria .
The patient had ANCA , anti-GBM , anti-streptolycin , ANA , UPEP , SPEP , renal ultrasound , hepatitis C cryoglobulin sent out .
He had a bronchoscopy immediately done which showed no fresh blood , just old clot and a pulmonary arterial line placed in the right internal jugular vein .
Question of pulmonary-renal syndrome was raised .
The patient subsequently deteriorated over time , was started on CVVH and suffered significant complications without improvement of his pulmonary / renal situation .
A family meeting was held on 5-2-98 and it was decided that the patient should be made comfort care only .
All CVVH and the ventilator was removed and the patient spontaneously passed away on 5-2-98 , at 4:55 p.m.
