ADMISSION DATE :

DISCHARGE DATE :
1-9-94
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 66 year old white female with metastatic colon carcinoma with a mass in the left superhilar region , who presents for bronchoscopy , mediastinal exploration and resection .
The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced the onset of abdominal pain in early 1992 .
In December of 1992 , she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon carcinoma which was Duke &apos;s grade B-II , lymph nodes were negative .
She received postoperative chemotherapy .
In September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan .
The exploratory laparotomy was negative .
She continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up .
In September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan .
In December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window .
She also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .
She also complains of increased shortness of breath for the preceding month and now presents for mediastinal exploration and resection of her probable metastatic mass .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on January 3 , 1994 where she underwent a median sternotomy with removal of her mediastinal mass .
This mass was situated in the aortopulmonary window and was sent to pathology .
The frozen section analysis revealed this to be adenocarcinoma , metastatic disease from the colon most likely .
She had a chest tube placed intraoperatively and another placed postoperatively in the recovery room , for what was presumed to be a left pleural effusion .
This tube drained only a small amount of fluid and it was likely that the effusion was made to look more severe in the presence of left hemidiaphragm elevation .
This additional chest tube was removed the following day .
Her postoperative hematocrit was 31 , compared to a preoperative level of 43 .
Her postoperative recovery was really quite remarkable .
Mediastinal chest tube was removed on postoperative day three .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on postoperative day six .
