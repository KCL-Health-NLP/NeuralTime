Admission Date :
07/10/1991
Discharge Date :
07/18/1991
PROCEDURES :
Thoracentesis was performed on 7-12-91 .
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
The patient is an 85-year-old white male with a history of ischemic bowel status post recent admission for urosepsis and C. difficile colitis .
He returns from the nursing home with fever , leukocytosis , and azotemia .
PRESENT ILLNESS :
Briefly , the patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , ethanol abuse , chronic pleural effusions , and chronic renal insufficiency .
He presented to Gaanvantsir on 04-17-92 with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea .
Workup revealed ischemic bowel secondary to Celiac and SMA stenoses .
The patient underwent an angioplasty of his SMA from 90-20% residual .
The patient was also found to have gram negative rod sepsis with blood cultures times two growing E. coli and B. fragilis .
The patient was treated with ampicillin , gentamicin , and Flagyl .
The patient was readmitted on 5-21-91 with a falling hematocrit from 36 to 22 , mild congestive heart failure , and guaiac positive stool .
The colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal series were negative .
The patient was given two units of packed red blood cells and H2 blockers .
His hematocrit was 31 on discharge .
His hematocrit was 31 on discharge .
On 6-12-91 the patient was admitted to Ingtermst.gay Health Center with fever , hypertension , and diarrhea .
The BUN and creatinine equalled 128/8.6 , CO2 equaled 12 .
The patient was treated with intravenous fluids , Kefzol , gentamicin , Vancomycin , and he was transferred to Gaanvantsir .
He was hospitalized from 6-12-91 to 7-9-91 with a prolonged course notable for :
1) Serratia urosepsis treated with ceftizoxime .
2) Azotemia presumed secondary to sepsis and dehydration , creatinine decreased to 2.1 with intravenous fluids and antibiotics .
Renal ultrasound was negative for abscess orhydronephrosis .
3) Loculated pleural effusions .
Thoracentesis revealed a pH of 7.18 , glucose 52 , white blood cell count 200 ; evaluated by thoracic surgery , no chest tube placed .
4) C. difficile colitis with white blood cell count rising to 51,000 , treated with intravenous and p.o. Flagyl .
C. difficile was negative times three prior to discharge .
The patient went to his nursing home on 7-9-91 but the next day he developed a temperature to 102.4 degrees , diarrhea , and orthostasis and he was transferred back to Gaanvantsir .
The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with question of sepsis .
White blood cell count was 40,000 with left shift .
The BUN was 35 , creatinine 4.3 .
Urinalysis had 5-10 white blood cells and 2+ bacteria .
The patient underwent thoracentesis without evidence of empyema .
He was treated with intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics with ceftizoxime , gentamicin , and Flagyl .
He was also started on p.o. Vancomycin for question C. difficile colitis .
He is now transferred to the medicine service for further care .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Colitis .
The patient has a history of ischemic bowel status post SMA Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty with recent admission for gram negative rod urosepsis complicated by C. difficile colitis .
The patient received a full course of Flagyl and was C. difficile toxin negative times three prior to transfer .
He now returns with fever , rising white count , diarrhea , and dehydration .
Initially treated with intravenous ceftizoxime , gentamicin , and Flagyl for presumed sepsis , either with urine or bowel source .
He was also started on p.o. Vancomycin .
Blood cultures and urine cultures came back negative .
Stool for C. difficile returned positive .
The diagnosis , therefore , was relapsed C. difficile colitis .
Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was continued on p.o. Vancomycin .
He improved clinically with defervescence , decreased white blood cell count to 10,000 with resolution of left shift , and some decrease in abdominal distention on exam .
An abdominal CAT scan revealed thickened bowel wall and thumb printing , primarily involving the cecum and right colon greater than the left , consistent with C. difficile colitis .
The diagnosis of recurrent bowel ischemia , however , was not ruled out and this will continue to be a concern in the future .
The patient was initially n.p.o. and was then advanced to clear liquids which he tolerated .
He will be advanced to soft solids prior to discharge .
2. Azotemia .
The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.8-2 .
Creatinine had risen to 4.3 on admission presumed secondary to sepsis and dehydration .
With intravenous hydration the BUN and creatinine fell to 12/1.9 which is within normal limits for this patient .
The abdominal CAT scan showed no evidence of hydronephrosis orrenal abscess .
3. Mental status .
The patient was alert and oriented throughout the admission ; however , by personality , he is somewhat cantankerous and demanding of the nurses .
He was written for Haldol 1 mg p.o b.i.d. p.r.n. to help with this problem .
