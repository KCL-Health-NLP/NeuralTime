Admission Date :
2011-06-14
Discharge Date :
2011-06-18
Service :
FICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 71-year-old-female with asthma and a history of recent exacerbation of lower extremity edema who , at her baseline , gets short of breath walking across the room and sleeps on four pillows times several years .
She has reported that she has had upper respiratory symptoms times several days with increasing dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath , eventually at rest with marked wheezing .
She also has a cough with a small amount of white sputum .
At 3 a.m. on the day of admission , she became much worse and after several days of increasing her meter-dosed inhaler use , she call Emergency Medical Services which assessed her as having heart failure with elevated jugular venous distention and rales .
She received aspirin , Lasix 40 mg intravenously times two , 0.8 mg of nitroglycerin times four , plus morphine sulfate .
Her blood pressure was noted to be up to 220/110 .
She was taken to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Emergency Room where she was assessed as having asthma .
She then received continuous nebulizer treatments for approximately eight hours with minimal improvement .
She did receive intravenous nitroglycerin in the Emergency Room for blood pressure controlled to the 170s .
She initially received a treatment of BiPAP on arrival as she was barely able to speak .
She also received 80 mg of Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department .
She was never hypoxic but initially her arterial blood gas showed a respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 of 71 .
The patient does have a vague history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , but this is felt to be inaccurate .
She also received captopril 12.5 mg times one .
Recently , the patient has been treated with several steroid tapers .
Depending on the family , patient , and the OMR records , the exact duration of the most recent one was unclear .
It either ended in 2011-04-11 or continued through 2011-05-11 with use of Augmentin ; and , by report , lasted until 06-07 .
However , the family said the patient has been on steroids for several weeks .
The patient denies any exposure to smoke , animals , unusual dust or vapors , or other asthma triggers .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. PULMONARY :
She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent continuous nebulizers and was weaned then to intermittent nebulizer treatments and then to her meter-dosed inhalers taking them q.4h. at the time of discharge .
She was continued on salmeterol and Flovent .
She was continued on Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8h. then converted to prednisone at 60 mg p.o. q.d.
She was started on Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Serial arterial blood gases were followed after an arterial line was placed .
Her PCO2 gradually declined to the 48 range .
Despite episodes of somnolence the first night which were presumably due to having spent the entire night in the Emergency Department , she never became more hypercarbic , and her PCO2 trended to 48 by the time the arterial line was discontinued .
On the night of admission and thereafter , she was noted to have a very stridorous sounding breathing when the patient was asleep .
This would disappear whenever she was awake .
Her case was discussed with Ear/Nose/Throat and the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending .
She was given a trial of 80/20 mixed helium/oxygen to decrease the stridor but had minimal effect .
Ear/Nose/Throat recommended not considering this an airway problem unless she was stridorous while awake .
The patient was to arrange for Pulmonary and Medicine followup through her primary care physician upon discharge as she has not been seen in the Pulmonary Clinic in two years .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial creatine kinases , although these did rise to 816 .
MB was negative .
She was treated with captopril for hypertension , and this was switched to Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. on discharge .
She had an echocardiogram which showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular of normal thickness and size , and no significant valvular disease .
She apparently did not have a cardiovascular component to her wheezing or shortness of breath ; however , she was to go home on Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. to help with lower extremity edema , as she experiences discomfort with this , and the team felt this may be a limiting factor with her prednisone compliance .
3. ENDOCRINE :
She was treated with a sliding-scale of regular insulin while she was in house .
She was given 500 mg p.o. q.d. of metformin to treat her steroid-induced diabetes on discharge .
This should be followed up by her primary care physician .
4. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
She was treated briefly with levofloxacin because of the gram-positive cocci in her sputum culture ; however , her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection , and levofloxacin was continued at the time of discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Combivent meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h. weaning to albuterol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h.
3. Salmeterol 2 puffs q.12h.
4. Flovent 220 mcg 2 puffs q.12h.
5. Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d. with taper .
6. Fentress 60 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Univasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
Dyazide was discontinued .
