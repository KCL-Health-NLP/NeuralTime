Discharge Date :

Service :
MEDICINE
History of Present Illness :
Patient is a 77 year old female with a past medical history significant for GI bleeding secondary to arteriovenous malformations , who presents with maroon stool and a hematocrit drop .
Three days ago began to develop black stools .
There was no clear blood in the toilet bowl .
In addition , she developed nausea and decreased PO intake .
She had a cough productive of white sputum and felt warm , although she did not record her temperature .
At dialysis on day of admission , she related these symptoms for the first time and had a bloody bowel movement .
Concerned , the staff sent her directly to the Nantucket Cottage Hospital .
In the Deanna , her temperature was 96.5 , HR 51 , BP 112/60 , RR 18 , and oxygen saturation was 98% on ambient air .
Her hematocrit was measured at 23.5 , while her baseline hematocrit is in the low 30 s.
An NG lavage was performed and there was bilious return .
Rectal examination was notable for guiaiac positive maroon stool .
She was type and crossed and transfused two units of packed red blood cells .
IV PPI was given and the GI team was consulted and she was scheduled for colonoscopy and EGD on the morning of 6/8 .
She was transferred to the CMED CCU for observation .
Brief Hospital Course :
Blood loss anemia from GI bleeding - the bleeding was likely from an AVM .
EGD , colonoscopy and tagged scan results as above .
eventhough uptake was noted in the rt LQ , no clear site of bleeding was noticed on colonoscopy .
hence , no intervention was performed .
she was transfused with 5 units of PRBC in the ICU andsent to the Lahey Clinic - North Shore .
Her hematocrit remained stable for 4 days prior to discharge .
No further bleeding noted .
GI consult team followed pt in hospital .
On discussion with Dr Leigh and Dr White from GI - they recommended that she follow with Dr. Taylor for consideration of argon photocoagulation as out-patient .
Given the innumerable number of AVM 's , it is diffcult to assess which the culprit lesion is and GI may start APL from the fundus of stomach .
Patient to get CBC checked with PCP this week as below .
ASA was held and may be restarted if Hct stable in clinic at the PCP 's discretion .
Chronic thrombocytopenia was noted , however the patient did not require platelet transfusions .
Has a h/o HIT .
The metoprolol was held during acute bleeding phase and restarted prior to discharge as her BP stabilized .
Other medical problems stable .
Dialysis was continued 3 / week .
I personally talked with Dr Pannell at the time of discharge to update him with the hospital events .
