Review of diffferences : nicol vs louise vs previous annotations on batch 1 of test docs 

312.xml : everybody agrees

293.xml : disagreement between N and L on the operation date : there are two operations ...
The "gs" : rather agrees with Nicol, this is probably an error on my end ? (but I would have anchored "POD1" wth the date of the first operation anyway ... )
but also they do not always anchor the pod to the operation date bc it is not always part of the 4 possibilities that they have 
Also : when there is an equal possibility, should we still anchor it to the operation date ? NO 

361.xml : agreement L&N
gs : super weird 

277.xml : no problem, well done for anchoring the times ! 

652.xml : no problem

441.xml : no problem

232.xml : i supposed error on nicol's part for the first expression "the night" = not the night of the admission, but after closely inspecting : there are two admission dates ... 
Also N did not anchor the relative times

78.xml : "the end of October" -> EXT 
"the 16th" : it is an incomplete time expression 

792.xml : No problem 

282.xml : "day of transfer" Nicol' solution seems correct after careful reading but I looked to the normalization to decide , is it incorrect ? gs agrees with L
