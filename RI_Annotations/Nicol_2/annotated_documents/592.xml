Baby Barbara Stead is a term infant admitted with increasing head circumference and bruising .
He was born to a 31-year-old G1 P0 now 1 mother with unremarkable prenatal screens as follows :

PREGNANCY HISTORY :
Estimated date of delivery was 2012-05-14 for estimated gestational age of 39-1/7 weeks .
Pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios with an AFI of 3.5 and by multiple evaluations for decreased fetal movement .
There was spontaneous onset of labor progressing through vacuum assisted vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia .
clear amniotic fluid , no antepartum maternal fever or fetal tachycardia , no antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis .
Baby was vigorous at delivery , was bulb suction , dried , and had free flow oxygen administered briefly .
Apgars were nine and nine .
In the Newborn Nursery , he initially had a caput which increased in the amount of swelling and bruising in the subsequent 24 hours .
He was then referred to the CMED CCU for assessment and management of the increased bleeding .
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS :
1. Respiratory :
Patient has been on room air maintaining sats above 95% .
No apnea or bradycardia .
2. Cardiovascular :
There was an initial murmur on admission likely secondary to severe anemia which has since resolved .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout this admission .
3. FEN :
Patient was restarted on po feeds as of day of life three after the bleeding had stabilized .
He has been taking breast milk or Enfamil 20 po adlib .
His admission weight was 3850 grams .
His weight on discharge was 4055 .
4. GI :
Given the significant amount of bleeding , baby was started prophylactically on phototherapy .
His bilirubin peaked on day of life three at 5.4 with a subsequent bilirubin of 4.6 at which time phototherapy was discontinued .
5. Hematology :
Given the rapid extension of the subgaleal bleed , coagulopathy workup was initiated revealing an elevated PTT level of 77 as well as factor 8 level that was below detection in the presence of normal factors 5 , 9 , 10 , and 11 .
He was started on a 50 units / kg bolus of factor 8 followed by continuous factor 8 infusions at 50 units / kg / day divided until hourly infusion rates at 05-10 .
Subsequent factor 8 levels varied with an initial factor 8 level of 18 after the bolus with which he received another bolus of factor 8 of 50 units / kg and increased factor 8 infusion rate to 65 units / kg / day .
As of 05-17 , he was switched over to bolus infusion in preparation of continued home factor 8 administration .
His peak level after a bolus of 75 units / kg of factor 8 was 131 .
A trough level at 20 hours after the bolus on day of discharge was 29 .
He will continue to receive factor 8 bolus q day for a total of 2-3 weeks in light of the intracranial hemorrhage , and will be followed by Hematology visiting nurse Michael Edwards level checks at home .
Currently , the infusion of factor 8 are going through a jugular Broviac which was placed on 05-15 for administration of factor .
His last PTT on 05-16 was 68.3 .
The last hematocrit was on 05-16 of 54.5 .

His head circumference on 05-18 was 36.5 cm with a maximum head circumference on
admission of 40.5 cm .
